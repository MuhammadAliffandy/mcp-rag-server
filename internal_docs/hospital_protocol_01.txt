# HOSPITAL INTERNAL PROTOCOL: TRIAGE & MES CLASSIFICATION (DUMMY)

1. PURPOSE
To provide a standardized procedure for classifying patients based on Metabolic Emergency Severity (MES).

2. CLASSIFICATION RULES
- MES Category 1 (Critical): High risk of organ failure. Requires immediate ICU admission.
- MES Category 2 (Urgent): Moderate risk. Observation required within 4 hours.
- MES Category 3 (Routine): Stable patient. Outpatient follow-up.

3. ANALYSIS WORKFLOW
When using the PineBioML system for MES:
- Always run 'PCA' first to see patient clustering.
- If clusters overlap, use 'Volcano' plots to find specific metabolic markers.
- Data cleaning MUST be performed before training any predictive models.
